							<h1>Erin E. Flowers, PhD</h1>
							<h3>Astrophysicist | Asst. Director of STEM Education | she/her/hers</h3>
							<h2>Hello!</h2>	
							<p>I am an astrophysicist and Assistant Director of STEM Education with the Council on Science and Technology at Princeton University. My research interests include both theoretical and observational exoplanet characterization and detection and astrobiology. I am currently a Researcher for the <a href="https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/index.php">NASA Dragonfly Mission</a>, working with Dr. Claire Newman and the <a href="https://aeolisresearch.com/">Aeolis Research Group</a> to create more accurate climate models of Titan, Saturn's largest moon. </p>
							<ul class="actions">

							</ul>
								<br />
							<p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about educational outreach in both astronomy and STEM as a whole. I am particularly dedicated to teaching and mentoring scientists-to-be from under-represented groups.</p>

									<h2>Exoplanets</h2>
									<p>Exoplanets - planets that orbit other stars - are a current "hot topic" in astronomy. As an undergraduate student at Columbia University, I modeled the atmosphere of a large, gaseous exoplanet known as HD 189733b, and compared the model output to observational data to constrain aspects of its atmospheric dynamics.</p>

									<h2>Stellar Atmospheres</h2>
									<p>In order to understand exoplanets, we need to understand the stars they orbit. Early in my graduate career, I analyzed a large sample of archival data of stellar observations. I analyzed these data to derive parameters for these stars, some of which are known to have exoplanets and others that are part of ongoing exoplanet studies. I also did a comparitive study on the different analysis techniques to assist other astronomers conducting similar research.</p>

									<h2>Titan</h2>
									<p>For my PhD thesis, I worked with Prof. Chris Chyba and Dr. Claire Newman to study Titan's atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and I continue this research to this day. I have returned to working with complex atmospheric models to predict large-scale climate patterns and chemical processes. I am conducting part of this research as a Guest Investigator for the <a href="https://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/index.php">NASA Dragonfly Mission</a>, which will send a probe to Titan in 2027.</p>

									<h2>Astronomy Public Outreach</h2>
									<p>For many years I have participated in and at times led public observing nights at each of my academic institutions, operating the department telescope, answering visitor questions, and giving informal lectures on astronomical topics. I also give talks around New York City at different schools and events, discussing my own research, my journey to becoming a scientist, and more. If you are interested in having me speak at your own event, please contact me via email or the form at the bottom of the page. </p>

									<h2>Prison Teaching Initiative</h2>
									<p>I volunteer as a math and science teacher with Princeton University's Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI), and I also have served as the Math and Physics Fellow with PTI. For a few weeks each semester, I go to a local state prison to teach a college course in math or science that the students can take for college credit or as a pre-requisite for a following creditable course. The students can take the courses provided by PTI to attain an Associate's Degree through a participating community college, and several students have gone on to attain Bachelors' Degrees from local universities. As a fellow, I curated course content, liase between other volunteers and PTI admin and partners, and coordinate the volunteers. For more information on PTI's mission and how to get involved, click the button below.</p>

									<h2>Princeton University Access, Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
									<p>As a graduate student, I served as a Diversity Fellow with Princeton's Graduate Office of Access, Diversity, and Inclusion (ADI). I and the other fellows developed programming for other graduate students from historically underrepresented groups to foster a sense of community and belonging on campus. These events can be social, professional, or health-oriented in nature, and have been executed at a variety of scales - from small focus groups to discuss campus issues, to our enormous annual picnics and spring Inclusive Academy Symposium which culminates in our Best of Access, Diversity and Inclusion (BADI) awards ceremony. For my final year, I served as the head Diversity Fellow, which involves supporting the other fellows, and additional duties traveling to recruit for our graduate programs.
